Key-takeaway
     We see its many types of learning explored for scheduling, including rote learning, inductive learning (ID3), neural network learning, case-based learning, classifier systems, and others. While each particular methodology offers powerful and negative features, the summary point - these learning systems seem to improve a scheduling system’s performance.
     Also, If the typical production environment is as dynamic as many believe them to be, the learning methods need to be dynamic themselves. Thus, fixed experiments for inductive learning may not be appropriate. Inherently dynamic learning methods are needed.  So the experiments should be periodical, so the learning for Application time t is not valid at time t+k, where t is the past time, k is gap time again the experiments should learn.

What
   I/O congestion caused by Concurrent storage accesses from multiple applications is certain, so it causes the performance issues.   
How 
  Traditional approaches either concentrate on optimizing an application’s access pattern individually or handle I/O requests on low-level storage layer without any knowledge of the upper-level applications. *In this paper they have considered a  view of both system state and jobs’ activities and can control jobs’ status on the fly during their execution*

what
  Clustering in mobile ad hoc network gained importance among researchers for easier maintenance of network. The problem in clustering of Manet is the
  frequent cluster re-affiliation and lack of stability of the network.

how
  In paper we see an brilliant approach to find the stability of the network using Genetic algorithm based on the average number of clusters, load balancing factors and weighted parameters.They have considered the factors the *evaluate funtions* such as density of the nodes,mobility,power and speed of the node.

	Typical result
| Line blocks are useful for addresses, 
| verse, and adornment-free lists. 
| 
| Each new line begins with a 
| vertical bar ("|"). 
|     Line breaks and initial indents 
|     are preserved. 
| Continuation lines are wrapped 
  portions of long lines; they begin 
  with spaces in place of vertical bars.
