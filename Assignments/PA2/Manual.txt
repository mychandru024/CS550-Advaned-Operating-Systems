Steps to run our program :

1. Place the shared shell script "run.sh" , shared jar file and corresponding configuration file in a seperate folder for each peer.
   For example :
	if I want to create a peers running on port 52001, I will create a folders(any name) and place "run.sh" , jar file and its config file "52001config.file" in it.
2. Run the shell script (./run.sh)
3. Default config? Y/N, Say N
4. Enter ipaddress of the system where peer is running (if it this system itself, enter "localhost")
5. Enter port where this peer has to run.. (I will say 52001 if I have placed 52001config.file)
6. later select options accordingly
7. If you download any files it will be stored in "sharedFolder(ip:port)". in my case "sharedFolderlocalhost:52001"
8. Any file shared by this peer should also be stored in this folder.. this folder will be created on peer's bootup
