Verification for linear topology with 10 peers :

peer1 at the sart and peer10 at the end

Peer1 has file1.txt
peer2 has file2.txt
peer3 has file3.txt


searching for file1.txt from peer10

Note that we are using TTL of 7, so the message is not reaching peer1

Console outputs of all peers from peer1 to peer10(Spaces are proveided to differentiate)


Note :
Message has reached peer3, but is not forwared to 2 as the TTL is 1 when it reached peer3
If peer3 had file1.txt it would have replied with queryhit message
